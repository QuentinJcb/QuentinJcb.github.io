# What shoudl I expect from a trading strategy based on a weak classifier?

## Context

Let's assume that for each small period of time (it could be 5 minutes, or 1 day), we have access to a prediction given by a weak classifier for the sign of the return of an asset on the next period. Therefore at time $t$, we forecast the sign of the return between $t$ and $t + \delta t$.
