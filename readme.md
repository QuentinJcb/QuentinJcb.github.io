# Bitcoin’s Price Movement Prediction With LSTM Neural Networks

## Introduction
This article is the first part of a long project overlapping finance and machine learning. Several papers explore the possibility to forecast the evolution of stock's market price movement using different machine learning algorithms, from SVM to neural networks [^fn1] [^fn2] [^fn3]. All these papers have in common the use of technical indicators to capture signal in the noise. Actually, such a quest goes against Eugene Fama's Efficient Markets Hypothesis [^fn4]. If there were any algorithme able to predict the evolution of stock's market price better than random, the price would immediately integrate this information. In fact, such a possibility only goes against the strong Efficient Market Hypothesis. There are empirical evidence of pockets of innefficiency in the market, should it be because of irrational behaviours from some investors, that a machine learning algorithm could exploit.
