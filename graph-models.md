# An introduction to graphical models

The purpose of this article is to explore graphical models from the very beginning and to answer some basic questions: what's the interest of representing
probability distributions with nodes and edges? What graphical interpretation of the Bayes' theorem can we give? How can problems from different fields
such as computer vision and velocity estimation have unified solutions?
